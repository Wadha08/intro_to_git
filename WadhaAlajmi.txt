I usually not that good when they asked me to write about myself. So, I’m just going to give some basic points about the things I love and makes me happy:
1.	Reading cause “reading is another life to live” and basically one life is not enough for me.
2.	Children. I love working in a place full of children they give me some kind of magical vibes.
3.	Traveling. I enjoy discovering new cultures and I have a list of the cities and country that I want to visit. The list contains 12 cities and I’ve visited 7 of them so far.
4.	Coding 
5.	Thriller, mystery, sci-fi, fiction and musical movies and series.
